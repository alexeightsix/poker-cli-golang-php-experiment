Learning Go by porting some existing PHP I wrote in the past.

Each app will create a new poker game with texas hold em rules, add 4 players, generate a random deck of cards and distribute 5 cards to each player.

The process will repeat itself 1,000,000 times.

Go runs in ~ 13 seconds while PHP takes ~ 120 seconds to finish execution.
