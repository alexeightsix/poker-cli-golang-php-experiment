Learning Go by porting some existing PHP I wrote in the past.

Each app will create a new poker game with texas hold em rules, add 4 players, generate a random deck of cards, distribute 5 cards to each player and calculate scoring for each player.

The process will repeat itself 1,000,000 times.

Go completes execution in ~ 13 seconds while PHP takes ~ 120 seconds to finish.

Interesting...
